# Developer Hub
## Description
    
Project Description:  We are creating an application to give prospective developers a handy resource to connect with other established developers and maintain an index of code snippets, terminology, and concepts to quickly and easily reference.  Users will create a profile and be able to add comments to a selection of various basic topics.  We will also give them a way to create their own snippets that other users can leave comments on.
