# TheBlackBook
## Description

We created an application to give prospective developers a handy resource to connect with other established developers and maintain an index of code snippets, terminology, and concepts to quickly reference. user will create a profile and be able to add comments to a selection of various basic topics. we will also give them a way to create their own snippets that other users can leave comments on.

- The motivation for this project as being a Bootcamp student was to provide a quick pocket reference for code snippets as well as having the experience to discuss this snippets.
